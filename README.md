# IR SENSOR INFO 
This is code of Ir sensor interfaced with arduino. this code contains the library of IRsensor of arduino ide. 
_For this code we are using the sensor named TSOP1838 IR sensor._ the code also work with other sensor.
> the circuit diagram for the code is 
## sensor         -->  arduino I/O ;
### pin1(signal)   -->     pin6 ;
### pin2(gnd)      -->     gnd ;
### pin3(Vcc)      -->      5V ;

The path of [IR sensor code] is (CODE).
