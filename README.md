# Ir_sensor_code
This is code of Ir sensor interfaced with arduino. this code contains the library of IRsensor of arduino ide. 
For this code we are using the sensor named TSOP1838 IR sensor. the code also work with other sensor.
the circuit diagram for the code is 
sensor         -->  arduino I/O
pin1(signal)   -->     pin6
pin2(gnd)      -->     gnd
pin3(Vcc)      -->      5V
